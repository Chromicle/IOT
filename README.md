# IOT
THE DEFINITION

According to Techopedia,
`Internet of Things (IoT) is a computing concept, that describes the idea of everyday physical objects being connected to the internet and being able to identify themselves to other devices.`

In past decade, there has been a steady increase in IoT devices every year. In very basic terms, IoT means connecting all the objects or devices that you see around using the incredible power of Internet.
Recently, there has been a pushing focus on connected devices as Alexa, Siri. These devices are under the umbrella of IoT. This post will introduce the world of IoT to you with the architecture, the currently available applications and finally illustrating some concerns.

## ARCHITECTURE
Internet of things is a combination of following three parts:

1. **Sensors and Actuators**
A physical quantity such as sound, temperature, moisture, etc. is measured in this particular part. This particular part acts as a transducer to convert the physical quantities into electrical signal.
2. **Connectivity**
This part is the communication medium with which the parts are supposed to exchange information or talk to each other. Predominantly, the examples are WiFi, Bluetooth or BLE, LoPAN, etc.
3. **Processes**
The ultimate part where the consumers get involved in. This part involves important decision making or data integration. It can also be seen as the application area for any given IoT idea.


## APPLICATIONS
There are extensive applications of IoT which you can see in below categories
– Consumer
– Commercial
– Industrial
– Infrastructure
I will take you through one example each from above categories.

**Smart Homes**

With advent of IoT more and more tech houses are going towards the Smart Homes phenomenon. For instance Google Homes and Apple Homes are increasingly becoming popular. Using smart home, your fridge would know when you are running out of milk and you can set the temperature/light of your bedroom according to the time of the day.

**Transportation**

Thanks to the devices such as wireless sensors and GPS, now one can track a vehicle and also see the conditions of cargo and relevant assets. There are many projects which use these type of tracking for effective delivery and tracking during transportation from one place to the other.

**Manufacturing**

Industrial IoT, or more familiar IIoT, is identified as industrial subset of IoT. Currently, predictive maintenance is the important focus area. After implementing IIoT, experts suggest it will generate $12 trillion of global GDP by 2030.

**Infrastructure**

With more and more metropolitan cities paying great attention towards the safety of their people, monitoring and controlling operations of infrastructures like bridges, railway tracks, etc. becomes very crucial task. IoT is currently helping the industry by time saving, cost reduction, etc.

**CONCERNS WITH IOT**

As the technology is getting ahead in the game, there are many pros as well as cons are cropping up. We will look at the most important concern with IoT – Privacy and Security Concern.

**Privacy and Security Concern**

With IoT, there is a potential threat for privacy invasion. As the world moves towards devices which monitor us, control over collected data from consumer carries a major importance. Security has become a nagging problem in relevance of adopting IoT, sometimes the consumers are ending up abandoning IoT devices and services

## Embedded systems

Embedded systems, the term, usually refers a lot to, not just how the device is used, but also how it's implemented, how it's built, so there is a lot of overlap between the two terms
Embedded systems are computer based systems that don't look like computers. That's my simple definition. The complexity of a computer is hidden from the user the user doesn't have to see the complexity of what's going on inside. The user just knows how to use it, so it has a very simple interface
