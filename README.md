## Embedded systems

Embedded systems, the term, usually refers a lot to, not just how the device is used, but also how it's implemented, how it's built, so there is a lot of overlap between the two terms
Embedded systems are computer based systems that don't look like computers. That's my simple definition. The complexity of a computer is hidden from the user the user doesn't have to see the complexity of what's going on inside. The user just knows how to use it, so it has a very simple interface
